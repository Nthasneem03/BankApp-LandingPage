# BankApp-LandingPage
A simple landing page for a bank app using React, my first React app



## Modified Files:
- `src/`
- `public/index.html`
- `tailwind.config.js`

## Setup Instructions:
1. **Create a New Vite React App**:

   First, create a new Vite-based React app on your local machine since the repository does not include all the files needed for a full Vite setup. Use the following command to create the React app with Vite:
      
      
   ```
   npm create vite@latest bank-app -- --template react
   ```
      
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
      Move into the newly created project directory:

      ```
      cd bank-app
      ```
3. **Replace Files from the Repository**:
   After creating the app, replace the following files in your new project with the ones from this repository:
   - `src/` (src folder)
   - `index.html` (Vite uses `index.html` in the root folder)
   - `tailwind.config.js`

4. Install Tailwind CSS: Install Tailwind CSS by running:
     ```bash
     
     npm install -D tailwindcss
     ```
5.  **Install Dependencies**:
   Install all required dependencies:
      ```
      npm install
      ```
6. Run the app:
     ```
     npm start dev
     ```


## Technologies Used:
